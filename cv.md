## *About myself*
I am 26 y.o. I am a doctor. But recently realise that I want to learn something as difficult as medicine. That's why I'm here.

## *Code example*

``` 
function getTime() {
    const now = new Date(),
            currentTime = now.toLocaleTimeString('en-GB'),
            timer = document.querySelector('.time');
    timer.textContent = currentTime;
    setTimeout(getTime, 1000);      
}

function getFullDate() {
    const options = {
        weekday: 'long',
        month: 'long', 
        day: 'numeric' 
    };
    const now = new Date();
    date.textContent = `${now.toLocaleDateString(userLang, options)}`;
}
```

## *Experience*
